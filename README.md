# N_Puzzle_and_N_Queen_AI

Contains scripts for solving n_puzzle (using bfs,dfs and heuristic searches) and n_queens (using genetic learning algorithm). 

The test.py script computes the time taken by all these algorithms for different values for n for n_puzzle and n_queen.

The runtime computations are then stored in the text files.

The Results_and_Analysis.pdf contains what it name suggests.
